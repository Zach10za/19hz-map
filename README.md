19hz.info does an amazing job at scraping and compiling electronic music events but for me there was something to be desired. I love the simplicity. The website is easy to use and loads extremely fast due to it's simple layout. 19hz-react is an attempt to expand on great scraping and compiling by adding more features to help people find events.
